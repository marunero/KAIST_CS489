## Start Adbalance api server

This server is written with node.js with express
To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, start the server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the server and it will be listening on the specified port (usually port 3000).

5. You can now access the server by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.
